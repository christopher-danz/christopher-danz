### Hey there, my name is Christopher. 

I'm a full-time working Machine Learning Engineer, with special interest in Deep Learning and MLOps. 

My current obsession is about Quantum Computing and it's applications along with other technologies. 
That is why I am taking a 2-semester course of Qubit by Qubit's program on Quantum Computing (https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/). 
**I am driven by the idea** to use my skills and knowledge to help other people and make their lifes easier and maybe even have a positive impact on our world.

**Are you interested in implementing AI that helps to make the world a better place?** Join the AI for Good community as well as the Climate Change AI community and collaborate on real-world projects. \

**In case you want to** exchange knowledge or collaborate on a topic, please feel free to contact me via any channel listed down below.

As a side project I want to create a ML model that generates electronic music and mix this generated music into sets, upload them on Soundcloud and further dabble around with music and ML.
Likewise, if you feel you'd like to collaborate, let me know.
